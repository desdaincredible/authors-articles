        content: "While hot dogs are in the lunchmeat section of the grocery store, they are not always all meat. There can sometimes be filler ingredients such as cartilege, bone, or pieces of mice that get in to the mix. Although this is a gross thing to think about, I choose to ignore these facts, load the toppings on and crush hotdogs like Joey Chestnut."
